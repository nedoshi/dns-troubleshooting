I'll create a comprehensive DNS troubleshooting tutorial for OpenShift environments. This will cover Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Dedicated (OSD), Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), and Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO).I've created a comprehensive DNS troubleshooting tutorial that covers all OpenShift variants (OCP, OSD, ROSA, and ARO). The guide includes:

**Key Features:**
- **Platform-specific considerations** for each OpenShift variant
- **Step-by-step troubleshooting** procedures with actual commands
- **Verification scripts** and automated health checks
- **Resolution strategies** for common DNS issues
- **Prevention and monitoring** best practices

**What's Covered:**
1. **DNS Architecture** - Understanding how DNS works in OpenShift
2. **Diagnostic Tools** - Commands and techniques for different cluster types
3. **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive verification procedures
4. **Platform Differences** - Specific considerations for ROSA (AWS), ARO (Azure), OSD, and self-managed OCP
5. **Automated Scripts** - Ready-to-use health check scripts

**Practical Elements:**
- Real YAML manifests for testing
- Command-line examples you can run directly
- Troubleshooting decision tree
- Monitoring and alerting configurations

The tutorial is designed to work across different cluster types by acknowledging the varying levels of access and control you have in managed vs self-managed environments. For managed services like ROSA and ARO, it focuses on what you can actually troubleshoot and configure, while for self-managed OCP, it includes infrastructure-level diagnostics.
